# ADS Protocol Configuration



The ADS protocol adapter enables direct communication with Beckhoff PLCs through the ADS (Automation Device Specification) protocol. The adapter requires configuration of AMS IDs and ports for both source and target devices, which are essential for establishing the ADS communication route.

Key configuration points:

- Source AMS ID/Port: Your SFC instance's ADS identity
- Target AMS ID/Port: The Beckhoff PLC's ADS identity
- AdapterDevice: References the specific Beckhoff PLC in your devices configuration
- Channels: Define the PLC variables you want to read, mapped to SFC channels

The adapter supports reading from various Beckhoff PLC data types and handles the protocol-specific details of ADS communication, making it straightforward to integrate Beckhoff data into your existing SFC data collection infrastructure.

In order to use this adapter as in [in-process](../sfc-running-adapters.md#running-protocol-adapters-in-process) type adapter the type must be added to the [AdapterTypes](../core/sfc-configuration.md#adaptertypes) section in the [SFC configuration file](../core/sfc-configuration.md).

```json
"AdapterTypes" :{
  "ADS" : {
    "JarFiles" : ["<location of deployment>/ads/lib"]
  },
  "FactoryClassName" : "com.amazonaws.sfc.ads.AdsAdapter"
}
```

## AdsSourceConfiguration

[SFC Configuration](../core/sfc-configuration.md) > [Sources](../core/sfc-configuration.md#sources) >  [Source](../core/source-configuration.md) 

Source configuration for the ADS protocol adapter. This type extends the SourceConfiguration type and defines the necessary parameters to establish communication with a Beckhoff PLC through the ADS protocol. It specifies both the source (SFC) and target (PLC) AMS identities required for ADS routing, along with the device reference and channel configurations for data collection.

Source configuration for the ADS protocol adapter. This type extends the [SourceConfiguration](../core/source-configuration.md) type. 

- [Schema](#adssourceconfiguration-schema)
- [Examples](#adssourceconfiguration-example) 

**Properties:**

- [AdapterDevice](#adapterdevice)
- [Channels](#channels)
- [SourceAmsId](#sourceamsid)
- [SourceAmsPort](#sourceamsport)
- [TargetAmsId](#targetamsid)
- [TargetAmsPort](#targetamsport)

---
### AdapterDevice
Specifies the device identifier that references a Beckhoff PLC defined in the Devices section of your ADS adapter configuration. This identifier must match an existing device entry in the ADS adapter's Devices configuration block. The referenced device contains the necessary PLC-specific settings and connection parameters required for establishing ADS communication.

**Type**: String

Must be an identifier of a server in the [Devices](#devices) section of the [ADS adapter](#adsadapterconfiguration) used by the source.

---
### Channels
Defines a map of channel configurations where each key is a unique channel identifier and each value contains the configuration for reading a specific PLC variable. Each channel specifies how to read and interpret data from the Beckhoff PLC, including the variable name, data type, and any necessary conversion parameters. The channel identifiers are used throughout SFC to reference these data points and must be unique within the source.

Individual channels can be disabled by prefixing their identifier with '#' in the configuration, allowing for easy testing and troubleshooting without removing the configuration.

**Type**: Map[String,[AdsChannelConfiguration](#adschannelconfiguration)]

At least 1 channel must be configured.

---
### SourceAmsId
The AMS (Automation Message Specification) NetID that identifies your SFC instance in the ADS network. The AMS NetID is a unique address in the format 'X.X.X.X.X.X' where X is a number between 0 and 255. This ID, combined with the AMS port, forms the complete ADS address that allows the Beckhoff PLC to recognize and communicate with your SFC instance as a valid ADS device.

For example: '192.168.1.10.1.1'

Note: The AMS NetID is different from an IP address, although the first four octets often match the IP address of the device. The last two octets are used to identify different ADS devices on the same network interface.


**Type**: String

The AMS Net ID consists of 6 bytes and is represented in a dot notation.

---
### SourceAmsPort
The AMS port number that, together with the AMS NetID, creates a unique address for your SFC instance in the ADS network. Each ADS device requires a specific port number that identifies the service or runtime system it represents.

For TwinCAT systems, the port numbers are predefined based on the runtime system:

TwinCAT 3:

- Runtime system 1: 851
- Runtime system 2: 852
- Runtime system 3: 853
- Runtime system 4: 854
- Runtime system 5: 855
- Additional runtime systems follow the pattern: 850 + n

- 

Choose the appropriate port number based on which TwinCAT runtime system your SFC instance needs to identify itself as when communicating with the PLC.

**Type**: Integer

---
### TargetAmsId
The Target AMS NetID identifies the Beckhoff PLC you want to communicate with in the ADS network. This is a unique address in the format 'X.X.X.X.X.X' where X is a number between 0 and 255 (for example: '192.168.1.20.1.1').

This ID represents the destination PLC for your ADS communications and must match the AMS NetID configured in the PLC's TwinCAT system. You can find the Target AMS NetID in TwinCAT by:

- Opening TwinCAT System Manager on the target PLC
- Right-clicking on the system tree
- Selecting 'Router' â†’ 'Show Route Settings'
- Looking for the 'AMS Net ID' field

The Target AMS NetID, combined with the Target AMS Port, forms the complete address that SFC uses to route ADS messages to the correct PLC in your network. Incorrect configuration of this ID will prevent successful communication with the PLC.


**Type**: String

The AMSNetID consists of 6 bytes and is represented in a dot notation. For clients this is typically the network address + .1.1, e.g. 192.168.1.65.1.1
To authorize the client this AMS Net ID must be added as an AMS route in the SYSTEM/Routes of the Twincat target.

---
### TargetAmsPort
The Target AMS Port specifies the port number of the service or runtime system you want to access on the target Beckhoff PLC. Together with the Target AMS NetID, it creates the complete address for routing messages to the correct service on the PLC.

**Type**: Integer

This can be any value.
